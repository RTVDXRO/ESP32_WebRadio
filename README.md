# ESP32_WebRadio
An Internet web radio based to ESP32

ESP32 connect to the Internet via WiFI (support WEP/WPA/WPA2), fetching MP3/AAC audio stream from your favourite webradios (mine is Dance Wave!). Then decode MP3 and send via I2S to DAC. The DAC simply output audio to a PAM8403 3W amplifier.

My grandpa made for me a fantastic wood case that sits perfectly on my book shelf in the linving room ;-)

This is the inside, with the mainboard, battery, charge/discharge module, speakers and, on the right, hide by a panel, the 4 buttons control board:

This is a detail of the Nokia 5110 LCD display:

## Configuration

Edit data/config.json file with your wifi ESSID and password. Fill data/streams.json with your favourites streams. Then burn the whole data directory into SPIFFS partition. Other stuff can be edited via web interface, available after successfull contection to the net. 

## Bill of materials

For a basic board:

- DOIT ESP32 WebKit v1 (or other suitable ESP32 board...) (On [AliExpress](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/4000141080480.html))
- CJMCU 5102 DAC [AliExpress](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/33023894667.html)
- PCD8544 LCD Display (aka NOKIA 5110 display) module (On [AliExpress](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32959195226.html))
- PAM8403 2*3W Amplifier board (On [AliExpress](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32968752490.html))
- One or more NeoPixel, but they are not mandatory ;-)
- Two 8 Ohm speaker
- 3 x 10K Ohm 1/8W resistors
- 2 x 100K Ohm trimmer
- 330 Ohm 1/8W resistor
- 860 Ohm 1/8 W resistor, only if you want to add one or more NeoPixels
- 3 push buttons (On [AliExpress](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32995191209.html))

On mine, i've added an 18650 LiBo battery and a voltage charge/discharge regulator (on [Aliexpress](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32824032545.html)), with key pin (connected to the fourth button) to power on and off. With this module, i can power (anche charge the battery) 
using USB. I've choosed an USB B connector (i have some lying on the table...) and it works perfecly ;-). With a fully charged battery, it can play sound at reasonable volume for about 2 hours.
